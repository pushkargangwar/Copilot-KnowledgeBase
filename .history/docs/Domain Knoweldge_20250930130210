Salesforce Domain Knowledge Base

Module: Lead Management
Purpose: Centralized business logic, validation rules, data model, and integration patterns for the Lead object in Salesforce.

Business Rules & Entity Relationships

Entities
Lead
Standard fields: 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Email', 'Company', 'LeadSource', 'Status'
Custom fields:
'Score__c' (Number): Aggregate score used to determine lead quality.
'Industry_Score__c' (Formula): Formula-based score derived from Industry.
'Email_Duplicate__c': Boolean used by deduplication logic.
Account
Created during lead conversion when no matching account is found.
Used to check related employee count ('Size__c') during scoring.
Relationship: Lead ➝ Account (1:M via Conversion)

Business Rules
Email Requirements:
Required field for all leads.
Email must be unique
For enterprise leads, email must end in 'telus.com' OR 'xavient.com'

Scoring Logic (Used for Qualification and Auto-Conversion):
'+5' if 'Industry == 'Technology''
'+10' if 'Account.Size__c > 500' (via lookup or external enrichment)
'+15': Lead Source = "Webinar" or "Event"
'+20': Email validated successfully (via API callout)
Auto-convert lead if 'Score__c > 50'

Auto-Conversion Logic
If 'Score__c > 50':
Trigger auto-conversion
Create Contact and Opportunity along with Account (if not matched)
Send notification to Sales Manager via Chatter post

Common Error Messages & Troubleshooting

Validation Errors

Code	Message	Triggered When	Resolution/Tips
DUPLICATE_EMAIL	"This email is already in use. Merge or update existing lead."	Duplicate found on Lead.Email during insert or conversion	Query: SELECT Id FROM Lead WHERE Email = :email LIMIT 1
INVALID_SCORE	"Lead score is not valid or missing."	Score__c is null or less than 0	Ensure scoring logic is applied before save or during batch processing
BLOCKED_DOMAIN	"Email domain not allowed for enterprise leads."	Email ends in non-telus.com domain for enterprise campaign leads	Validate domain in before insert trigger

Integration Errors

Code	Message	When It Happens	Resolution
API_TIMEOUT	"External email validation service timed out. Retry in 5 mins."	Callout to Hunter.io or other enrichment service fails	Log via System.debug, retry with exponential backoff
MISSING_ACCOUNT_INFO	"Could not retrieve company size data for scoring."	Enrichment service fails to return size info	Fallback to manual input or default scoring logic
